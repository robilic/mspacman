# mspacman

Pac-man style game written in Javascript, using HTML Canvas. It's complete enough to be fun to play, however there are some more things that it needs to be 'finished'.

Playable version hosted [here](http://opti.isovega.net/MsPacMan/pacman.html)

+ double buffer background graphics
+ add keys for debug, drawing layers
+ add dots

+ add tunnels
+ no animation if pac not moving

+ fix turns (pacman can't turn unless the block he's going into is free)
+ skip top/bottom and edges of screen when drawing pills (micro-op)
+ increment ghost speeds 75, 85, 95% (25fps = 18.75, 21.25, 23.75)
+ add slowdown when eating dots
+ eating dot slows pac down .5 not 1

# TODO

+ add a little bit of leeway to turns (actual game lets you turn a pixel early)
+ die animation (mouth open up left down right)
+ add fruit, make it dance around
+ make ghosts start in home
+ release ghosts based on counters
+ add key to +/- speed
+ call 'tiles' something else. art, graphics, bitmaps, whatever
